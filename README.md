This repository consists of files which are used for analysing the how different age groups in England are affected by obesity. The question which will be answering is whether the children(Below 16) are affected by obesity or not.  
The data is taken from Data.gov.uk. Weâ€™ll be using the 2014 XLS file. Download it, and open it in your spreadsheet tool
of choice.
