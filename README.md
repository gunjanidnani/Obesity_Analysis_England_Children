#Obesity_Analysis_England_Children

This repository consists of files which are used for analysing the how different age groups in England are affected by obesity. The question which will be answering is whether the children(Below 16) are affected by obesity or not.  
The data is taken from Data.gov.uk. 

For this analysis I have used pandas and various data visualization techniques for representing the results. This analysis will help in understanding the reason behind the obesity in people of England.
